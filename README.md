## heroku-mongo-backup *â€” backup mongodb and push it to S3 on Heroku*

**heroku-mongo-backup** does:

1. Backup mongodb collections to one file;
2. Compress backup file with gzip;
3. Push backup to the specified S3 bucket;

> Why not mongodump command?

*mongodump* command is not available on Heroku side. If you don't want to setup third party backup service for every project *heroku-mongo-backup* may be helpful.


## Configuration

1. Add gem to the ```Gemfile```: ```gem "heroku-mongo-backup"```

For S3 support **heroku-mongo-backup** requires ```s3``` or ```aws-s3``` library. One of those should be in ```Gemfile```, if any of those two is present add ```aws-s3```.

2. Require for *heroku_mongo_backup* in ```config\application.rb```:

```
...
  class Application < Rails::Application
    require 'heroku_mongo_backup'
...
```

3. Add backup task to ```/lib/tasks/cron.rake``` file:

```
desc "This task is called by the Heroku cron add-on"
task :cron => :environment do
  Rake::Task['mongo:backup'].invoke
end
```

4. Set Heroku environment variables:

```heroku config:add S3_BACKUPS_BUCKET=_value_ S3_KEY_ID=_value_ S3_SECRET_KEY=_value_ MONGO_URL=_value_```

First three are Amazon S3 auth settings and the last one should be copy of *MONGOHQ_URI* or *MONGOLAB_URI* depending on what heroku add-on is used for mongo. *MONGO_URL* is a variable which is used also for **heroku-mongo-sync** command.

## Rake Commands

* ```heroku rake mongo:backup```
* ```heroku rake mongo:restore FILE=backup-file-name.gz```
