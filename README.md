# heroku-mongo-backup â€” backup mongodb and push it to S3 on Heroku

> Why not to use regular mongodump command?

*mongodump* command is not available on Heroku side. To backup database third party service should be used. If you don't want to setup third party for every project *heroku-mongo-backup* may be helpful.

**heroku-mongo-backup** does:

1. Backup db collections to the single file;
2. Gunzip the file;
3. Pushes backup to the specified S3 bucket;


## Setup and configuration

Add library to the ```Gemfile```:

```gem "heroku-mongo-backup"``` or ```gem "heroku-mongo-backup", :git => 'git://github.com/alexkravets/heroku-mongo-backup.git'```

**heroku-mongo-backup** requires ```s3``` or ```aws-s3``` library. So one of those should be in ```Gemfile```. If there is no any of these two, add ```aws-s3```.

Add backup task to ```/lib/tasks/cron.rake``` file:

```
require 'heroku_mongo_backup'

desc "This task is called by the Heroku cron add-on"
task :cron => :environment do
  if Time.now.hour == 0 # run at midnight
    HerokuMongoBackup::Backup.new.backup
  end
end
```

Set Heroku environment variables:

```heroku config:add S3_BUCKET=_value_ S3_KEY_ID=_value_ S3_SECRET_KEY=_value_ MONGO_URL=_value_```

First three are Amazon S3 auth settings and the last one should be copy of *MONGOHQ_URI* or *MONGOLAB_URI* depending on what heroku add-on is used for mongo. *MONGO_URL* is a variable which is used also for **heroku-mongo-sync** command.

**Rake commands:**

* ```heroku rake mongo:backup```
* ```heroku rake mongo:restore FILE=backup-file-name.gz```
